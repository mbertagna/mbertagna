- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm @mbertagna, an aspiring software engineer based in California.

ðŸŽ“ I have a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and a Minor in Computer Science from Chapman University and am seeking opportunities to start my career as a Software Engineer.

ðŸš€ In the summer of 2022, I worked with @ajeldorado at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop [Coralign](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/coralign), a well-documented software for automated alignment of coronagraph optics using test-driven development. I created a documentation generation pipeline for NumPy docstrings using Sphinx and developed, managed, and reviewed Python 3 code using Git and Github. I also implemented continuous integration with Github Actions and Jenkins, and created a tutorial for future contributors. Additionally, I wrote unit tests using the Pytest testing framework and developed interactive Jupyter notebooks to showcase alignment simulations.

I designed an iterative algorithm for focal and pupil plane alignment and translated alignment algorithms from MATLAB to Python 3.

ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about learning new software frameworks, and in my free time, you can find me creating tools and applications in Python 3, developing 3D models, 3D printing my models, and hanging out at the beach.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate on any interesting software projects. I'm always happy to chat and connect with like-minded individuals.

ðŸ“« You can contact me via bertagna@chapman.edu, and you can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bertagna/).
