- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm @mbertagna, an aspiring software engineer based in California.

ðŸŽ“ I have a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and a Minor in Computer Science from Chapman University and am seeking opportunities to start my career as a Software Engineer.

ðŸš€ During the summer of 2022, I collaborated with @ajeldorado at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to build Coralign, a meticulously documented software for automating the alignment of coronagraph optics via test-driven development. My responsibilities included designing an iterative algorithm for aligning the focal and pupil planes, as well as converting existing alignment algorithms from MATLAB to Python 3. I also created a pipeline for generating documentation using Sphinx and NumPy docstrings, managed and reviewed Python 3 code using Git and Github, and implemented continuous integration with Github Actions and Jenkins. To assist future contributors, I created a tutorial, wrote unit tests using the Pytest testing framework, and developed interactive Jupyter notebooks to showcase alignment simulations.

ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about learning new software frameworks, and in my free time, you can find me creating tools and applications in Python 3, developing 3D models, 3D printing my models, and hanging out at the beach.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate on any interesting software projects. I'm always happy to chat and connect with like-minded individuals.

ðŸ“« You can contact me via bertagna@chapman.edu, and you can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bertagna/).
